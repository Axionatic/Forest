Click sparingly, be patient üå≥

Made with [Precessing](https://bernhardfritz.github.io/p8g/).

### Instructions
1. Clone or download.
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. `npm run watch` to build dev (`eval`) mode with source watching.
4. Serve from `/dist` with your favourite local server. Hot-reload encouraged. [This one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is pretty good.
5. Mess with sketch constants for fun ~~and profit~~.

Enjoy!

You may also build with `npm run build` for minified output in `/dist`. If you end up using it somewhere, please let me know! ‚ù§Ô∏è
